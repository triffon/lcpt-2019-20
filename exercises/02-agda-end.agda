-- AGDA CHEATSHEET (descending importance):
-- <SPC> m l - reload file

-- <SPC> m , - (in goal) show context and goal

-- <SPC> m . - (in goal) show type of expression in goal. if goal is empty agda will ask for an expression to type

-- <SPC> m c - case split on goal contents
--             if goal is empty, will ask for what to split on

-- <SPC> m r - introduce constructor (if non-ambiguous)
--             can also introduce constructors, lambdas, record constructors
--             if there's a function in the goal it will "introduce" it with its arguments as new goals

-- <SPC> m <SPC> - when in a goal, replace the goal with the expression currently in the goal
--               if the goal is empty, agda will ask for an expression to insert
--               obviously only works if types match

-- <SPC> m a - (invoke "agsy") agda try your best to figure this out!
--             you can add names to a goal to give hints to agda, e.g. if you want to use a function "f"

-- EXERCISE |
-------------

-- a haskell type declaration
--data List a
--  = Nil
--  | Cons a (List a)
--

-- same thing but in agda
--data List (A : Set) : Set where
--  Nil : List A
--  Cons : A -> List A -> List A

-- X : Y - "X is of type Y"
-- Set is the "kind" of types
-- it's safe to just read it as "Type" instead

-- identity function, with an explicit type as an argument
-- in agda we don't have (and don't need) "implicit polymorphic types"
-- like how in haskell when we write a -> a we actually mean "for all a (a -> a)"
-- so instead we "simulate" it by taking a type as an argument
id' : (A : Set) -> A -> A
id' _ x = x

-- we can also have it implicitly inferred, by using {} to specify the argument
-- agda doesn't have global type inference (because it's not decidable in general) - you always need to write top level signatures
id : {A : Set} -> A -> A
id x = x

-- a data type definition
-- it has no constructors
-- therefore it cannot be constructed!
-- this is an encoding of "falsity" exactly because you can't make values (proofs) of it
-- called Zero because it contains 0 values
data Zero : Set where -- ⊥

-- therefore if you are handed something of Zero
-- you can try to inspect it, to show that it's not possible for it to exist!
-- this is "efq"
naughtE : {A : Set} -> Zero -> A
naughtE ()
--      ^ this bit is special syntax for "impossible case" - not the same thing as () in haskell

-- a record type - "dual" in some sense to a data type
-- very similar to a struct in C:
-- in order to construct a record type, you need to give values for all its fields
-- this record has *no* fields, therefore to construct it you need to give *no values*
-- and it is therefore very easy to construct
-- it encodes "trivial truth" in logic, exactly because you don't need any assumptions to create it
-- the "constructor <>" syntax introduces a convenient way to create values from this type, instead of using record syntax
-- called One because it contains one value
record One : Set where -- unit/top/⊤
  constructor <>

-- an example value from One
one : One
one = <>

-- an example value constructed with record syntax
one' : One
one' = record {} -- no values to give!

-- example of a record type with some actual fields!
--record Student : Set where
--  field
--    fn : Number -- these types don't actually exist yet, but let's assume they do
--    name : String
--
--georgi : Student
--georgi =
--  record
--    { fn = {!81248!}
--    ; name = {!"Georgi"!}
--    }


-- boolean values - to construct a Two we either use the ff or the tt constructor
-- called Two because it has two values
data Two : Set where
  ff : Two
  tt : Two

-- an example of "mixfix" syntax
-- we can define a function with three arguments
-- the _s are where we would place arguments
if_then_else_ : {A : Set} -> Two -> A -> A -> A
if ff then t else e = e
if tt then t else e = t

-- we can write ordinary functions that return types, based on some value!
-- this function "promotes" the boolean *values* to their "corresponding" *logical types*
-- e.g. we convert the boolean "false" to our encoding of falsity - the type Zero
IsTrue : Two -> Set
IsTrue ff = Zero
IsTrue tt = One

_ : IsTrue tt
_ = <>

-- a sum type - it's either the left thing or the right thing
-- Either in haskell
-- as a logical construction it's a proof of either a or either b
data _+_ (A B : Set) : Set where -- A || B
  inl : A -> A + B
  inr : B -> A + B

_ : Zero + One
_ = inr <>

-- two-tuples defined as a record
-- a logical encoding for proof of *both* a *and* b
-- (a, b) in haskell
-- we will instead get this as a special case from our next construction
--record _*_ (A B : Set) : Set where -- A && B
--  constructor _,_
--  field
--    fst : A
--    snd : B

-- a **dependent two-tuple** - called a sigma type in books
-- **the type of the second field can depend on the value of the first**
-- this is an encoding of "exists" quantifiers-
-- to prove (constructively) ∃x.P(x), you must give me a x₀, and then prove that P(x₀)
-- which is effectively a two-tuple of a value x, and a proof P x
record _><_ (A : Set) (P : A -> Set) : Set where
  constructor _,_
  field
    fst : A
    snd : P fst

infixr 15 _><_
open _><_

-- an example of a dependent tuple
-- we give a value, and then show proof that the value satisfies our predicate "IsTrue"
-- ofcourse, if we give the value ff, we would not be able to construct this, because we cannot prove Zero
_ : Two >< IsTrue
_ = tt , <>

-- another example of construction of a sigma type
--data Nat : Set where
--  zero : Nat
--  suc : Nat -> Nat
--
--three : Nat
--three = suc (suc (suc zero))
--
--Even : Nat -> Set
--Even zero = One
--Even (suc zero) = Zero
--Even (suc (suc x)) = Even x
--
--twoIsEven : Nat >< Even
--twoIsEven = (suc (suc zero)) , <>

-- and now we can get our regular 2-tuples for free as a special case of sigma types
-- in which the second argument doesn't depend on the first (notice how our lambda ignores its argument)
_*_ : (A B : Set) -> Set
A * B = A >< \_ -> B
infixr 15 _*_

-- we can encode Either using a sigma type with Two as our left type!
-- to construct an Either
-- you must either use tt (the "left" constructor) in which case our if then else will compute to A, therefore we must give an A
-- or you must either use ff (the "right" constructor) in which case our if then else will compute to B, therefore we must give a B
Either : (A B : Set) -> Set
Either A B = Two >< \b -> if b then A else' B
  where
  -- note: I used another version of if_then_else, because our original one had arguments that are **values of some type**, i.e. (x : A), for some A : Set,
  -- but here we're actually using the **A itself** as an argument, and our original function handle this
  -- this one is **polymorphic over levels** (similar to kind polymorphism in haskell) - it works for both (x : A) and for (A : Set) and for a lot of other stuff
  if_then_else'_ : forall {l} -> {A : Set l} -> Two -> A -> A -> A
  if ff then t else' e = e

-- an example of a function using _*_
-- and a theorem at the same time
-- if you know that A * B is true, then you can also prove B * A (so some kind of symmetry/commutativity)

-- peano-encoded natural numbers
data Nat : Set where
  zero : Nat
  suc : Nat -> Nat -- a recursive case in a constructor
{-# BUILTIN NATURAL Nat #-} -- pragma allows us to write literals, e.g. 2 to mean (suc (suc zero)), and also to compile these to Integer, if we compile to haskell

-- traditional left-recursive peano nat addition
-- how you define your functions has great repercussions!

infixr 30 _+N_

-- an equality type
-- to show that x == y for some values x and y
-- you can do only one thing: show that x and y are actually the same value (by using the refl constructor)
-- this "syntactic equality" is internal to agda, but you can think of it as basically "the same structure" (when you look at e.g. constructors)
data _==_ {A : Set} : A -> A -> Set where
  refl : {x : A} -> x == x

infix 20 _==_
{-# BUILTIN EQUALITY _==_ #-} -- allows us to use rewrites for this equality type


-- a proof that 2 is equal to 2
-- since 2 is the same syntactic object (suc (suc zero)) as itself, we can use refl
twoIsTwo : 2 == 2
twoIsTwo = refl

-- similarly, in this case 1 +N 1 is not immediately the same thing as 2
-- but agda automatically applies (beta-reduces) the definition of +N as much as possible,
-- and can calculate that they are actually the same!
onePlusOneIsTwo : (1 +N 1) == 2
onePlusOneIsTwo = refl

-- another way to define == where the x is a parameter instead
--data _=='_ {A : Set} (x : A) -> A -> Set where
--  refl : x == x

-- a proof demonstrating how to use ==
-- this states that if you have two proofs of x and y being equal
-- then the proofs themselves are equal to one another!
==-unique : {A : Set} {x y : A} (p1 p2 : x == y) -> p1 == p2
==-unique refl refl = refl
-- note that this is not always true, and it is an active area of research (homotopy type theory),
-- which might provide solutions to problems in constructive mathematics
-- in it, you cannot prove this theorem, and indeed, there are p1 and p2 there, which *are not* equal to each other

-- ap allows us to "apply a function to both sides of an equality"
-- i.e. on a piece of paper we automatically assume this, because f is a function
ap : {A B : Set} {x y : A} (f : A -> B) -> x == y -> f x == f y
ap f refl = refl

-- this proof doesn't need to look at n at all, because we have a case for 0 +N _ in the definition of +N
-- and agda can automatically compute it
+N-left-zero : (n : Nat) -> 0 +N n == n
+N-left-zero n = refl

-- but it is not the same in this case!
-- and thus we use recursion to prove this
+N-right-zero : (n : Nat) -> n +N 0 == n
+N-right-zero zero = refl
+N-right-zero (suc n') = ap suc (+N-right-zero n')
-- another alternative to the last case would be to use "rewrite"
-- the rewrite declaration allows us to "rewrite" our goal by using an equality provided by us
-- i.e. if we have a goal that has some x's in it, and we have a proof (p : x == y)
-- then rewrite p will change all the x's into y's in our goal
